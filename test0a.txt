"Carol Of The Bells"

Hark how the bells,
Sweet silver bells,
All seem to say,
Throw cares away

Christmas is here,
Bringing good cheer,
To young and old,
Meek and the bold,

Oh how they pound,
Raising the sound,
O'er hill and dale,
Telling their tale,

Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer,
Christmas is here,

Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas,
Merry, merry, m"Carol Of The Bells"
